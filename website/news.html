				<h2>Cryptocat, Now with File Sharing</h2>
				<p class="newsDate">April 8, 2016</p>
				<p>
					Good evening from the city that never sleeps. I've been in Manhattan all week, ostensibly on a vacation that nevertheless saw me jumping from coffee shop to coffee shop to get some programming time. I am happy to announce that Cryptocat now allows you to share files easily and quickly, while chatting with your buddies.
				</p>
				<img src="img/3.0.25.png" style="width:auto;height:auto;float:left;margin-right:20px;" alt="" />
				<p>
					This is wonderful news. File sharing was Cryptocat's
					most-requested feature, with group chat coming in second.
					Update 3.0.25 allows you to share files of all kinds and up
					to <span class="strike">25MB</span> <a data-scroll href="#3.0.31">50MB</a> in size. Technically, the file sharing scheme is simple: it piggy-backs on top of the existing authenticated secure messaging session. The file is simply encrypted and authenticated using AES in Galois Counter Mode with a random key, and a pointer to the encrypted blob is sent along with that key as a regular chat message, which gets parsed appropriately by the client as an encrypted file being shared.
				</p>
				<p>
					Cryptocat is using Microsoft Azure to transmit encrypted
					files. Azure will be able to determine the size of
					transmitted files, but neither Azure nor Cryptocat will be
					able to determine anything else about the files, be it their
					content, name, whom you're sending them to, and so on. Files
					remain available for <span class="strike">seven</span> <a
					data-scroll href="#3.0.31">thirty</a> days, and a limit of
					<span class="strike">25MB</span> <a data-scroll href="#3.0.31">50MB</a> per file is
					imposed in order to save costs: remember that Cryptocat is a
					non-profit project! I am footing the Azure bill out of my
					own pocket; but it's a small price to pay for the
					satisfaction of writing good software that does something meaningful.
				</p>
				<p>
					To send a file, simply update to Cryptocat 3.0.25. Then, opening a chat window will show a small blue floppy disk button (pictured.) You may also press <span class="code">Alt+F</span> within the chat window to launch the Send File dialog.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here is the complete change log for Update 3.0.25:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><em>New feature!</em> Send files within chats with buddies.</li>
					<li>Various small improvements to the user interface.</li>
					<li>Various small bug fixes.</li>
