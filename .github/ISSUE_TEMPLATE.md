### Reporting Bugs
If you are reporting a bug, please consider the following questions first:

* Can you reliably reproduce the bug you are reporting? Are you sure your description is accurate?
* Will the Cryptocat developers be able to reproduce your bug? What information will they need?

### Proposing Enhancements
If you would like to propose an enhancement, first consider:

* Is your enhancement's value almost entirely subjective (change Cryptocat's color scheme to your favorite color, etc.)? If so, please do not open a new issue.
* Is your enhancement only valuable to your specific use-case or would it be useful to a general base of Cryptocat users? Please do not open a new issue if the former case applies.
* Can your proposed enhancement be described in concrete steps? Does it fit well with the current architecture?

### Other Issues
General questions are somewhat welcome on the issue tracker, but please limit your discussions to outside the scope of your personal opinion as much as possible. Your personal views on a feature are a waste of time. Consider rather how a feature or change would affect the software's consistency and its viability towards its larger userbase.
